## The long story of Ã–bEngine and dependencies

I love searching for dependencies and to be honest, that's one of my favorite past-time.

This series of blog posts will try to summarize information about all the dependencies I used, use or simply stumbled upon. Each post of the series will try to tackle one category of dependency :

- Windowing
- Graphics
- Scripting
- Audio
- Network
- GUI
- Maths
- Serialization
- Compression
- Debugging & Logging
- Testing
